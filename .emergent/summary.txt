The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two major areas: refining existing UI/UX elements and implementing a comprehensive WordPress integration (both headless and classic theme). Initially, the application featured basic multilingual support, currency conversion, and contact information.

The first phase involved user-requested UI/UX improvements. This included removing luxury travel branding from various text elements, harmonizing the site's background color to a dark  (after several iterations involving gradients and solid colors), and updating specific contact details for the Portuguese version.

The second, more substantial phase, centered on enabling a WordPress backend. The AI engineer developed a headless WordPress integration, including custom services (, , ) to fetch posts, destinations (CPT), regions (taxonomy), and pages via REST API. Concurrently, a full WordPress theme () was built, replicating the frontend design and incorporating templates for various pages, CPTs, ACF fields, and i18n support. Throughout this process, numerous static destination images and data were added and refined in , and comprehensive WordPress XML import files (with and without attachments) were generated and frequently updated to reflect these changes. Several syntax and ESLint errors were encountered and resolved during code modifications, particularly in .

The MC Viagens web application aims to offer low-cost international travel with an affordable luxury design, primarily using a blue/gold palette. It features a multilingual header, a dynamic hero section, a destinations catalog, About/MC Viagens, About Me, Minha Trajetória blog articles, testimonials, a contact form, and a footer.

Prior development established core internationalization (PT, FR, EN), image optimization, and dynamic currency conversion (BRL, USD, EUR). Site-wide contact details were also updated.

The current trajectory focused on:
1.  **Branding Refinement:** Remove all explicit luxury travel mentions, replacing them with MC Viagens or an accessible standard, while retaining the luxury-themed blue/gold color palette.
2.  **UI Color Harmony:** Harmonize the entire site's background color, specifically ensuring the body, header, and footer share a consistent dark blue shade () and applying uniform translucent blue backgrounds to internal cards/modals (Option B).
3.  **WordPress Backend Integration:** Provide the full frontend source code and implement features for both a headless WordPress backend (using REST API for blog, contact form, custom post types for destinations, pages) and a classic WordPress theme conversion that maintains the existing design. This includes:
    *   Migration of existing static content (blog articles, About pages, destinations) to WordPress-compatible structures.
    *   Creation of a WordPress plugin for Custom Post Types (CPT) for Destinations and Regions taxonomy with associated metadata (price, duration, images, etc.).
    *   Generation of WordPress XML import files (demo data with images).
    *   Full i18n support for the WordPress theme and plugin.
    *   Integration of legal pages (Mentions légales, Politique de confidentialité) with auto-linking.
4.  **Destination Data & Image Enrichment:** Continuously update and expand the list of global destinations in the app preview (static data) and the WordPress import files, ensuring all destinations have appropriate and visible images, including specific capitals and newly requested regions like Switzerland/Geneva.

-   **XML Attachments Extension:** The AI engineer offered to extend the  file to include explicit attachment details for Hanoï, Pékin, Sydney, Auckland, Maldives, Punta Cana, Réunion, and Maurice so they also get automatically assigned featured images in WordPress. This task was implicitly accepted by the user in chat message 292.
-   **Image Update for Europe (Switzerland/Geneva and others):** The user specifically requested image changes for Paris (Eiffel Tower), Rome (Colosseum), Athens (Greek temple), Spain (belle photo), and Geneva (Swiss landscape).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively resolving a critical syntax error in  (), which caused the frontend application to fail compilation and not display. This error was due to an accidentally pasted JSON fragment at the top of the file.

The AI offered two options: a platform rollback or an immediate hotfix. The user chose the Hotfix immediate option (Chat Message 311). The AI engineer then successfully removed the offending JSON fragment from , restoring the file's valid structure and fixing the compilation issue.

Following this fix, the user immediately requested further image updates for specific European destinations, including Paris (Tour Eiffel), Rome (Colisée), Athens (Greek temple), Spain (belle photo), and Geneva (Swiss landscape). The AI engineer is poised to implement these image changes.

The application's static frontend (app preview) now includes a comprehensive set of destinations and regions with updated images. The site's background is uniformly . The WordPress integration assets (headless services, CPT plugin, theme, XML imports) are all in place and have been updated multiple times to reflect the growing list of destinations and image references.
