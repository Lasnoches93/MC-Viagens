The web application aims to offer low-cost international travel, inspired by voyage-prive.com, initially under Jheny Mamani and later rebranded as MC Viagens. The design emphasizes a premium, affordable luxury style with a color palette evolving from black/gold to a luxurious blue/gold, incorporating modern UI elements like glass-morphism, subtle shadows, rounded corners, animations, gradients, and parallax effects with contrasting typography.

Key sections include:
1.  **Header & Navigation**: Logo (MC Viagens), fluid navigation, mobile menu, and a language selector (Brazilian Portuguese, English, French).
2.  **Hero Section**: Immersive full-screen experience with a catchy title, subtitle, CTA, and a dynamic background image. This evolved to feature a subtle background carousel.
3.  **Destinations**: A catalog of international travel packages organized by regions (South America, Europe, North America, Asia, Oceania, Paradise Islands), including pricing, flight details, and baggage information. It supports online booking with detailed modals. This section required significant performance and image optimization.
4.  **About/MC Viagens**: Presentation of expertise (5 years experience, 30+ countries, Latin America specialist, deal finder), later updated to emphasize post-sale support and personalized advice. This section was integrated into the blog.
5.  **Testimonials**: A carousel displaying customer social proof.
6.  **Blog de Voyage**: Articles, filters, and a newsletter signup. This section was expanded to include About, About Me, and Minha Trajetória as articles, with full translation support for all content.
7.  **Contact/Personalized Quote**: A contact form for quotes, including points of strength like 15% discount in case of dissatisfaction.
8.  **Footer**: Two-level navigation, contact information, social links, legal text, and a newsletter.

Ongoing requirements included performance optimization (destination load time reduced from 2 minutes to 0.05 seconds), image optimization, and full internationalization of the entire site. Recent requests focused on integrating dynamic content like carousels and detailed about me narratives within the blog structure, ensuring full multi-language support for all blog content, and adding a specific image for the Sobre a MC Viagens section.

This involved updating the  file (Chat Message 233-238) to include comprehensive translations for each blog article, including titles, descriptions, and content for Portuguese, French, and English. Following this, the  component was modified (Chat Message 239-242) to dynamically fetch and display blog post data based on the currently selected language using a  function and the  hook. A screenshot was taken (Chat Message 244-245) to confirm that the Hero section and the blog content displayed correctly in Portuguese, which was the default language.

However, the user's request (Chat Message 232) also explicitly included: inclu également une photo qui fonctionne pour sobre a MC viagens qui fonctionne. This part of the request, pertaining to adding a specific image for the Sobre a MC Viagens section, has not been addressed or confirmed as completed in the subsequent messages. Therefore, while the blog content translation mechanism is largely in place, the image aspect of the latest request remains outstanding.
